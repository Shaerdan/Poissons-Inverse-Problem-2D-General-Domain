function w = boundary_integral_equation(x, y, z)
% BOUNDARY_INTEGRAL_EQUATION Computes the conformal mapping from the unit disk to a polygon using the boundary integral equation method
% x, y: vertices of the polygon
% z: points in the unit disk
% w: image of the points in the disk in the complex plane

% Number of vertices of the polygon
n = length(x);

% Number of points in the disk
m = length(z);

% Allocate memory for the image of the points in the disk
w = zeros(m, 1);

% Compute the boundary integral equation
